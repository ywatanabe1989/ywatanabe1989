## Basics

1. Master Google Search
   - The challenges you face may have already been solved by someone
2. Actively utilize AI
   - [Emacs package genai.el](https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/genai/)
4. Learn keyboard shortcuts
   - Cover your walls with printed cheat sheets
   - Extend the convenience of Ctrl + C

## Advanced (If you want to make programming your career)

### Mindset

1. Conduct all computer operations in English
   - Computers don't seem to be primarily designed for Japanese users
   - Gain international opportunities through IELTS [My IELTS learning app](https://ai-ielts.app/)
     - Currently, Canada and Australia may offer permanent residency with a Ph.D. and IELTS 7.0 or higher
2. Minimize mouse usage
   - Try not to move your hands from the keyboard's home position
3. Read technical books, documentation, and blog posts
   - Especially in the early stages, grasping the big picture from reliable technical books is helpful

### Software

1. Utilize Linux for programming
   - It's unavoidable in this world
   - I think reading the 3 books of [Linux Textbook LinuC Level 1](https://www.amazon.co.jp/s?k=linux+%E3%83%AC%E3%83%99%E3%83%AB1&crid=RJR3JEEZ0J2T&sprefix=linux+%2Caps%2C287&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_7_6) is a good start
   - Continuously improve your Linux configuration [My dotfiles repository](https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/.dotfiles-public)
2. Create lots of functions
   - They're like vending machines: press a button, get a cola, every time, without worrying about what's inside
3. Learn and use Emacs
   - It doesn't have to be Emacs (it's a religion) as far as I know, it's about not wanting to take your hands off the keyboard and focusing on code
   - Start with the tutorial `M-x help-with-tutorial`
     - Launch Emacs and enter `M-x help-with-tutorial RET` (Meta (Alt or Esc) key + x, then type 'help-with-tutorial' and press Enter)
   - [SystemCrafters YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEoMzSkcN8oPH1au7H6B7bBJ4ZO7BXjSZ)
     - It's fun just to watch
   - [My Emacs configuration](https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/.dotfiles-public/tree/main/.emacs.d/inits)
     - Creating your own configuration from scratch helps you understand what's happening and how to program
4. Continuously update your personal toolbox
   - Having working functions somewhere in your drawer is useful [Example of my Python toolkit](https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/mngs)
5. Create and optimize your own shortcuts
   - [My bash shortcuts](https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/.dotfiles-public/tree/main/.bash.d/all)
   - [My Emacs shortcuts](https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/.dotfiles-public/.emacs.d/)
6. Make full use of GitHub
   - Write for others. Others include your future self and yourself on other machines. [My GitHub repository](https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/)

### Tools

1. Use a [blank HHKB keyboard](https://hhkeyboard.us/hhkb/pro-hybrid-type-s/sku/cg01000-297301)
   - You'll never look at the keyboard (as it's meaningless), so you'll learn to feel even the most intricate symbol and modifier key combinations
   - For example, you'll press the Fn key in the bottom left with the base of your left pinky finger

2. Build a PC at least once
   - It's very effective for understanding the components
   - It's mainly about power supply, motherboard, CPU, CPU cooler, storage, GPU, keyboard, and mouse

## In Conclusion

Enjoy coding!
