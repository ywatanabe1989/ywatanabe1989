## Advice for my younger self as a programming newbee

### Basic Skills
1. Master Google Search 
   - You are not the first person who meets your challenges
   - Remember, your 'unique' problem has probably been solved by someone else at 3 AM
2. Embrace AI technologies actively
3. Achieve English proficiency
   - Ace the IELTS exam for international opportunities
   - [My IELTS preparation resource](https://ai-ielts.app/)
4. Adopt and utilize Linux
5. Learn keyboard shortcuts thoroughly
   - Cover your wall with cheat sheets
6. Minimize mouse usage
7. Seriously read online resources (official documentation, GitHub discussions, Stack Overflow, Reddit, etc.)

### Advanced Practices
1. Continuously refine your Linux configuration
   - [My dotfiles repository](https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/.dotfiles-public)
2. Develop and maintain a personal toolbox
   - [My toolkit example](https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/mngs)
3. Use [HHKB Keyboard with blank keycaps](https://hhkeyboard.us/hhkb/pro-hybrid-type-s/sku/cg01000-297301)
   - The blank HHKB will teach you proper finger placement every time you make a mistake
   - In fact, your left palm exists for pressing the function key
4. Learn and use Emacs
   - Start with the tutorial: `M-x help-with-tutorial`
     - Launch Emacs and type `M-x help-with-tutorial RET` (Meta (Alt or Esc) key + x, then type 'help-with-tutorial' and press Enter)
   - [SystemCrafters YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEoMzSkcN8oPH1au7H6B7bBJ4ZO7BXjSZ)
   - [My Emacs configuration](https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/.dotfiles-public/tree/main/.emacs.d/inits)
5. Create and optimize your own shortcuts
   - [My bash shortcuts](https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/.dotfiles-public/.bash.d/all/)
   - [My Emacs shortcuts](https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/.dotfiles-public/.emacs.d/)
6. Utilize GitHub
   - [My GitHub profile](https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/)
   - Write for others. Others include your future self.
7. Don't hesitate to read technical books, documentation, and blog posts

### Final Thoughts
  Enjoy your coding and believe in yourself
