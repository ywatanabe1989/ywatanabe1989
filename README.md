## Hi there 👋

I'm Yusuke, a postdoctoral fellow who spends way too much time optimizing my keyboard shortcuts instead of actually doing research.

The following messages to myself in the past might inspire students.
- [Advice for my younger self as a programming newbee](./advice-for-my-younger-myself-en.md) (English)
- [プログラミングを始めたばかりの過去の自分へ](./advice-for-my-younger-myself-ja.md) (Japanese)
