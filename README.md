## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yusuke, currently a postdoctoral fellow specializing in neuroscience and biomedical engineering.

## Advice for my younger self

- Basic
  - Use Google Search
  - Use AI
  - Use English ([my case](https://ai-ielts.app/))
  - Use Linux
  - Use Shortcuts
  - Do not use mouse as much as possible
  - Rely on peers on the Internet

- Advanced
  - Configure your Linux ([my case](https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/.dotfiles-public))
  - Maintain your own toolbox ([my case](https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/mngs))
  - Use [HHKB Keyboard](https://hhkeyboard.us/hhkb/pro-hybrid-type-s/sku/cg01000-297301)
  - Use [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). I highly recommend [this YouTube channel by @SystemCrafters](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEoMzSkcN8oPH1au7H6B7bBJ4ZO7BXjSZ). ([my case](https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/.dotfiles-public/tree/main/.emacs.d/inits))
    - Do not use Vim, Visual Studio, or Jupyter, <b>as I am not familiar with them</b>.
  - Create shortcuts ([my case 1](https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/.dotfiles-public/.bash.d/all/)) ([my case 2](https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/.dotfiles-public/.emacs.d/))
  - Embrace documents
  - Use [GitHub](https://github.com/home) ([my case](https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/))
    - Write code for others, especially for you in the future
  - Read books, documents, and posts
