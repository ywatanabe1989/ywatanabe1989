\section{Basics}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Master Google Search
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The challenges you face may have already been solved by someone
    \end{itemize}
    \item Actively utilize AI
    \item Learn keyboard shortcuts
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Cover your walls with printed cheat sheets
        \item Extend the convenience of Ctrl + C
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{Advanced (If you want to make programming your career)}

\subsection{Mindset}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Conduct all computer operations in English
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Computers don't seem to be primarily designed for Japanese users
        \item Gain international opportunities through IELTS \href{https://ai-ielts.app/}{My IELTS learning app}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Currently, Canada and Australia may offer permanent residency with a Ph.D. and IELTS 7.0 or higher
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Minimize mouse usage
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Try not to move your hands from the keyboard's home position
    \end{itemize}
    \item Read technical books, documentation, and blog posts
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Especially in the early stages, grasping the big picture from reliable technical books is helpful
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Software}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Utilize Linux for programming
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It's unavoidable in this world
        \item I think reading the 3 books of \href{https://www.amazon.co.jp/s?k=linux+\%E3\%83\%AC\%E3\%83\%99\%E3\%83\%AB1&crid=RJR3JEEZ0J2T&sprefix=linux+\%2Caps\%2C287&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_7_6}{Linux Textbook LinuC Level 1} is a good start
        \item Continuously improve your Linux configuration \href{https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/.dotfiles-public}{My dotfiles repository}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Create lots of functions
    \begin{itemize}
        \item They're like vending machines: press a button, get a cola, every time, without worrying about what's inside
    \end{itemize}
    \item Learn and use Emacs
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It doesn't have to be Emacs (it's a religion) as far as I know, it's about not wanting to take your hands off the keyboard and focusing on code
        \item Start with the tutorial \texttt{M-x help-with-tutorial}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Launch Emacs and enter \texttt{M-x help-with-tutorial RET} (Meta (Alt or Esc) key + x, then type 'help-with-tutorial' and press Enter)
        \end{itemize}
        \item \href{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEoMzSkcN8oPH1au7H6B7bBJ4ZO7BXjSZ}{SystemCrafters YouTube channel}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item It's fun just to watch
        \end{itemize}
        \item \href{https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/.dotfiles-public/tree/main/.emacs.d/inits}{My Emacs configuration}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Creating your own configuration from scratch helps you understand what's happening and how to program
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Continuously update your personal toolbox
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Having working functions somewhere in your drawer is useful \href{https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/mngs}{Example of my Python toolkit}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Create and optimize your own shortcuts
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \href{https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/.dotfiles-public/tree/main/.bash.d/all}{My bash shortcuts}
        \item \href{https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/.dotfiles-public/.emacs.d/}{My Emacs shortcuts}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Make full use of GitHub
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Write for others. Others include your future self and yourself on other machines. \href{https://github.com/ywatanabe1989/}{My GitHub repository}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tools}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use a \href{https://hhkeyboard.us/hhkb/pro-hybrid-type-s/sku/cg01000-297301}{blank HHKB keyboard}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item You'll never look at the keyboard (as it's meaningless), so you'll learn to feel even the most intricate symbol and modifier key combinations
        \item For example, you'll press the Fn key in the bottom left with the base of your left pinky finger
    \end{itemize}
    \item Build a PC at least once
    \begin{itemize}
        \item It's very effective for understanding the components
        \item It's mainly about power supply, motherboard, CPU, CPU cooler, storage, GPU, keyboard, and mouse
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{In Conclusion}

Enjoy coding!
